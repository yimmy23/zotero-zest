/**
 * Exception-proof wrappers for callbacks that Zotero invokes WITHOUT any
 * try/catch of its own (ItemPaneManager hooks, MenuManager callbacks…).
 * A throw from a plugin hook aborts Zotero's whole item-pane render loop
 * and takes the native sections down with it — so plugin hooks must never
 * throw. Errors are logged to both the plugin log and Zotero's error
 * console instead.
